# Codebook

This describes the steps that were taken to create tidy data from fitbit training/test data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

run_analysis.R will create the tidy dataset by going through the following steps:
- Load up the features and normalize the values
- get indices with the mean and std deviation values
- load the training set (this comprises the subject, label and raw value data sets)
- load the test set (this comprises the subject, label and raw value data sets
- merge the test and training data sets
- add descriptive activity labels
- create a tidy summary data table that calculates the average for each variable over each activity and subject and output it as tidy.txt

The resullting dataset has the following activities and variables:
Below are the different types of activities
- 1 WALKING
- 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- 4 SITTING
- 5 STANDING
- 6 LAYING
